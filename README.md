## ðŸ”¥ About This Repository

This repo serves as my personal learning lab as I dive deep into modern Java development concepts, design patterns, data structures, algorithms, and real-world application scenarios.  
I document every step, experiment with code implementations, and perform detailed analyses to solidify my understanding â€” transforming theory into practice.

From building optimized search algorithms for e-commerce platforms to developing recursive financial forecasting models, every folder tells a story of growth, curiosity, and relentless pursuit of excellence.

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights and Key Learnings


- **Week 1:**
- Rigorous application of **Big O notation** to critically analyze algorithm efficiency.  
- Implementation and comparison of **linear vs binary search** within real-world data structures.  
- Mastery of **recursion** and its optimization via iterative approaches for financial computations.  
- Practical usage of **Java collections, sorting, and comparators** to manage complex datasets.  
- Understanding and applying **software design patterns** to write clean, reusable, and scalable code.



-**Week 2:**
Diving deeper into backend robustness and testing best practices, Week 2 is centered around database programming, unit testing frameworks, and effective logging.

-Hands-on experience with PL/SQL to create, optimize, and manage stored procedures and scripts, reinforcing an understanding of database-driven application design and control structures.
-Rigorous practice of JUnit 5 for writing precise and maintainable unit tests, emphasizing features like parameterized tests, lifecycle callbacks, and assertions.
-Embracing Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles that foster cleaner code architecture, faster debugging, and improved reliability through writing tests before implementing functionalities.
-Integration of SLF4J logging framework to enable consistent, level-based logging practices that facilitate better monitoring, debugging, and audit trails in Java applications.
-This week focuses on bridging the gap between development and quality assurance by embedding testing and logging deeply within the coding workflowâ€”empowering the creation of resilient, testable, and maintainable Java applications.

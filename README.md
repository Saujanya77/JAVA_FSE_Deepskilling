## ðŸ”¥ About This Repository

This repo serves as my personal learning lab as I dive deep into modern Java development concepts, design patterns, data structures, algorithms, and real-world application scenarios.  
I document every step, experiment with code implementations, and perform detailed analyses to solidify my understanding â€” transforming theory into practice.

From building optimized search algorithms for e-commerce platforms to developing recursive financial forecasting models, every folder tells a story of growth, curiosity, and relentless pursuit of excellence.

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights and Key Learnings


- **Week 1:**
- Rigorous application of **Big O notation** to critically analyze algorithm efficiency.  
- Implementation and comparison of **linear vs binary search** within real-world data structures.  
- Mastery of **recursion** and its optimization via iterative approaches for financial computations.  
- Practical usage of **Java collections, sorting, and comparators** to manage complex datasets.  
- Understanding and applying **software design patterns** to write clean, reusable, and scalable code.



- **Week 2:**
- Hands-on experience with PL/SQL to create, optimize, and manage stored procedures and scripts, reinforcing an understanding of database-driven application design and control structures.
- Rigorous practice of JUnit 5 for writing precise and maintainable unit tests, emphasizing features like parameterized tests, lifecycle callbacks, and assertions. 
- Embracing Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles that foster cleaner code architecture, faster debugging, and improved reliability through writing tests before implementing functionalities. 
- Integration of SLF4J logging framework to enable consistent, level-based logging practices that facilitate better monitoring, debugging, and audit trails in Java applications. 
- Diving deeper into backend robustness and testing best practices, Week 2 is centered around database programming, unit testing frameworks, and effective logging.

- **Week 3:**
- Hands-on practice of Spring IoC container configuration using XML (applicationContext.xml) to define and inject beans, gaining confidence in Springâ€™s inversion of control concepts.
- Explored setter injection and constructor injection, understanding how and when to use each for maximum flexibility and cleaner code architecture.
- Mastered creating Spring Boot applications from scratch using Spring Initializr, simplifying dependency management and bootstrapping the application faster.
- Developed a fully functional Library Management System REST API using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and H2 in-memory database, including CRUD operations and testing via Postman and H2 console.
- Advanced learning with Country Management Service using Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA with MySQL, implementing complete CRUD functionalities and search capabilities (e.g., searching countries by partial name).
- Practiced writing dynamic queries using Spring Data JPA Query Methods, including findByNameContainingIgnoreCase, which automatically generate SQL based on method names.
- Gained experience with HQL (Hibernate Query Language) and native SQL queries, learning how to fetch specific data (e.g., permanent employees, quiz attempts) and how to optimize queries using @Query annotations.
- Understood and implemented object-relational mapping (O/R mapping) using JPA annotations like @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany, and learned how to structure entity relationships effectively.
- Explored Criteria Query API for building dynamic, runtime-generated queries based on user-selected filters, mimicking real-world scenarios like advanced product searches on e-commerce platforms.
